*TO REVIEW (GENERATED BY CHAT-GPT):*
- Radiology Report: Explanation of the findings of a radiological study, including interpretations of medical images.
- Chest X-Ray (CXR): A type of radiography specifically for the chest, used to diagnose conditions affecting the chest, its contents, and nearby structures.
- Computed Tomography (CT): Advanced imaging technique used to obtain detailed internal images of the body.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): A type of imaging that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues within the body.
- Positron Emission Tomography (PET): An imaging test that helps reveal how your tissues and organs are functioning.
- Ultrasound: Imaging method that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures within your body.
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score: Key metrics used to evaluate the performance of automated systems in accurately generating radiology reports.
- CheXpert: An automated tool for labeling radiology reports based on certain findings or observations.
- CheXbert: A deep learning model that automatically labels radiology reports with clinical observations.
- Machine Learning (ML): A branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from and make decisions based on data.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): A field of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages.
- False Positive (FP) / False Negative (FN): Inaccurate results produced by a diagnostic test, including incorrectly identifying a condition as present (FP) or failing to detect a condition (FN).
- True Positive (TP) / True Negative (TN): Accurate results produced by a diagnostic test, including correctly identifying a condition as present (TP) or absent (TN).
- Inter-observer Variability: Differences in the interpretation of medical images among different observers.
- Intra-observer Variability: The variability of reading or interpreting images by the same observer at different times.
- Annotation: The process of labeling medical images or reports for the purpose of training machine learning models.
- Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI): A measure used in information theory and statistics to examine the discrepancy between the probability of two events occurring together and the probability of them occurring independently.
- Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A type of deep learning algorithm often used in image recognition and processing.
- Pulmonary: Relating to the lungs.



Resources
- **Purpose**: To have a central place for additional resources.
- **Contents**: Links to online resources, datasets, tools, forums, and anything else that's been helpful or relevant to your research.

Glossary
- **Purpose**: Define terms and jargon.
- **Contents**: A list of technical terms, abbreviations, and jargon used in chest radiology report generation, with their definitions. This can be very helpful for newcomers to the field.
